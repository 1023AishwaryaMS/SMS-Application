SMS Application - 6th Semester College Project


Description:
The SMS Application is a project developed during the 6th semester of my college program, showcasing my skills in Java, XML, and Android XML files. The main objective of this application is to provide users with a user-friendly interface to send and receive SMS messages on their Android devices. The app allows users to efficiently manage their SMS communications and enhances their messaging experience.

Key Features:

Compose and Send SMS: Users can compose SMS messages using an intuitive interface, and then send them to their contacts or phone numbers of their choice. The app uses the built-in SMS manager in Android to handle message sending securely and efficiently.

Inbox and Sent Items: The application features separate sections for incoming messages (Inbox) and outgoing messages (Sent Items), making it easy for users to keep track of their conversations and messages.

Contact Integration: The app utilizes the device's contact list, enabling users to select recipients directly from their contacts. This integration streamlines the process of sending messages and minimizes the risk of typing errors.

Message Threads: SMS conversations with a specific contact are organized into threaded conversations, providing users with a chat-like view for more natural and coherent communication.

Message Search: Users can search for specific messages based on keywords, sender, or date, making it convenient to find past conversations quickly.

User Settings: The application offers a settings section where users can customize various aspects of the app, such as notification preferences, theme, font size, etc.

Technologies Used:

Java: The core functionality of the SMS application is built using Java, the widely-used programming language for Android app development.

XML: XML is utilized to define the user interface and layout of the application screens. It ensures that the app's design is easily maintainable and responsive on different devices.

Android XML Files: Android XML files are employed to handle various resources, including layouts, strings, colors, styles, and more, contributing to the overall look and feel of the application.

GitHub Repository:
The project's source code and related resources are available on GitHub here. Feel free to explore the code, suggest improvements, or use it as a reference for your own projects. Any feedback or contributions are greatly appreciated!

Note:
This SMS Application is solely intended for educational and non-commercial purposes, developed as part of a college project to demonstrate proficiency in Android app development using Java and XML.
